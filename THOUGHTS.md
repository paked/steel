# Thoughts
These are my thoughts relating to this project.

* I hate school.
    * make the learning process smoother
* Make this an engaging learning experience
    * better peer <-> peer interaction
    * collaboration options
    * a nice showcase
* Needs to not be modelled after a teacher relationship
    * no "this is your task, this is what you do"
    * options
    * students can add their own tasks
        * this isn't for every class though...
        * plugin model?
* NEEDS TO BE FLUID
* Possible usage at hackEDU
    * easy applicable model
* I want myself to use it for managing classes
* I need it to not make me want to cry when i look at it
