Steel is a platform for running code clubs. It *is not* a complete solution, as it only gives to the *tools* to run the club, not the guide. Using steel allows you to keep your own teaching style while using a battle tested system to automate the menial parts of running your club/group.

Steel will help you:

* enroll your students
* manage assignments
* organise collaboration between students
* test students' code
* help motivate students
